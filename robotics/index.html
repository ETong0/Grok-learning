	<!--//starter paragraph-->
	<p id="intro">Robotics is the intersection of science, engineering and technology that produces machines, called robots, that substitute for (or replicate) human actions. Robotic is a fast-growing industry growing around 26% each year with millions of dollar being poured into research every year. the effect of robotics on society will increase as it takes over more and more of the things human are doing now and understanding it is more important than ever.</p>

	<h2>What Is Robotics</h2>
	
	<p>As technology progresses, so too does the scope of what is considered robotics. In 2005 90% of robots consist mainly of mechanical arms tasked with welding or screwing on certain parts of a car. Today, we’re seeing an evolved and expanded definition of robotics that includes the development, creation and use of bots that explore Earth’s harshest conditions, robots that assist law-enforcement and even robots that assist in almost every facet of healthcare.   While the overall world of robotics is expanding, a robot has some consistent characteristics:</p>
	
	<ol>
  		<li>Robots all consist of some sort of mechanical construction. The mechanical aspect of a robot helps it complete tasks in the environment for which it’s designed. For example, the Mars 2020 Rover’s wheels are individually motorized and made of titanium tubing that help it firmly grip the harsh terrain of the red planet.</li>
		
  		<li>Robots need electrical components that control and power the machinery. Essentially, an electric current (a battery, for example) is needed to power a large majority of robots.</li>
		
  		<li>Robots contain at least some level of computer programming. Without a set of code telling it what to do, a robot would just be another piece of simple machinery. Inserting a program into a robot gives it the ability to know when and how to carry out a task.</li>
	</ol>
	
	<p>We’re really bound to see the promise of the robotics industry sooner, rather than later, as artificial intelligence and software also continue to progress. In the near future, thanks to advances in these technologies, robots will continue getting smarter, more flexible and more energy efficient. They’ll also continue to be a main focal point in smart factories, where they’ll take on more difficult challenges and help to secure global supply chains.</p>
	
	<p>Though relatively young, the robotics industry is filled with an admirable promise of progress that science fiction could once only dream about. From the deepest depths of our oceans to thousands of miles in outer space, robots will be found performing tasks that humans couldn’t dream of achieving alone.</p>

	<h2>Types Of Robot</h2>
	
	<h3>Industrial Robots</h3>
	
	<img class="image" src="img/industrial-robots.jpg" alt="industrial robots">
	
	<p>An industrial robot is an automatically controlled, reprogrammable, multipurpose manipulator programmable in three or more axes. The field of industrial robotics may be more practically defined as the study, design and use of robot systems for manufacturing.</p>
	
	<p>Industrial robot is mrst commenly used for industrial automation to automate the process of producing goods, speeding up the production and replacing manue labor. Typical applications of industrial robots include welding, painting, ironing, assembly, pick and place, palletizing, product inspection, and testing, all accomplished with high endurance, speed, and precision. In the context of general robotics, most types of industrial robots would fall into the category of robot arms.</p>
	
	<h3>Domestic Robots</h3>
	
	<img class="image" src="img/domestic-robot.jpg" alt"domestic robot">
	
	<p>Domestic robots are devices that are designed to manage various types of tasks around the house. Domestic Robots can have a range of different function from focus on functions such as house cleaning to provide company for the elderly, monitor the activities of young children, and operate kitchen appliances. Although the number of domestic robot in use today is small, it has broad range of capabilities that are currently under development by a number of different companies</p>
	
	<p>Of all the domestic robots currently in use today, the most common is the smart vacuum. The small and relatively simplistic robot is capable of maneuvering around the floor of a room and altomate the process of cleaning the floor, allowing poeple to have time for more enjoyable and urgent matters. </p>
	
	<p>Another type of robots that is used today is used to connect systems within the home, using a wired or wireless connection, like Google Home. This type of domestic robot gives you moer contral other your house often through vioce commend and can even be used as part of home security networks. They are often also designed to provide interactive entertainment and companionship with it's user, able to have a basic converastion and complete take on the internet gievn by through vioce command.</p>
