	<h2>The Future Of Robotics</h2>	
	
	<p>Robotics has gotten more and more sophisticated through out the years and technoligy advances with the passage of time. Through the advancement on all electronics, robots are getting faster and faaster processing powers, allowing them to make more decisions by themsleves that's not precoded into them. This is allowing us to biuld incresingly intelegient robot that are more capable then ever before. At the moment, advancement on artifical inteligents more not the most susccesful field simply because we are not even sure what makes ourselves inteligent. Magor advancement had been made in the mobility of robots and AI learning.</p>

	<h3>Mobility</h3>

	<p>Major inprovement in the mobility of robotics on uncontroled environment had been made by learning from and mimicing the ways animals move around. One of the company leading this field of stuidy is Boston Dynamics with their two most seccessful robots imitating the movement of dogs and humans. As evolution as prefected the movement of animals over milions of years, the movement of animals are way more effective then the unatrual movement made up by human and this is proven by the projects of Boston Dynamics as their robots are not only able to move around in namy difficult terrains but only able to balance it self even when bening pushed. Their Robot human has also became viral with the video of it doing a backflip without all by itself. As the movement of robots continues to advance, they would nolonger be confined to flat man made grouds, allowing then to be able to carry out mission to all corners of earth, effectively increasing their capability and range of effect.</p>
	
	
	<h3>Genetic Algorithm</h3>

	<p>Genetic algorithm also take the aprotch of learning from nature by using the concept of evoltion in competer code. As the need for robot become more and more sophisticated some times human don't acctually know what is the best way to program the robot. As a way around this, genetic algorithm is used in a very similer way to evolution, a program is through into the the task it need to compelet. At first it would not know anything and just act completely random but each round the program the does the best will ne kept with it's "offpring", program with mimor mutation being put into the next round. This way, through randombility and the sheer number of test, one program will be progused with a extemly effecient process of completing a task.</p>
