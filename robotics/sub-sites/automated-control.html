	<h2>Overview</h2>

	<h2>Origins Of Automation</h2>
	
	<img class="image" src="img/Automation-1.jpg" alt="industrial robots">
	
	<p>The earliest form of automation happened in 1589 with the introduction of automated knitting machine. Queen Elizabeth denies William Lee a patent for automated knitting contraption citing fear it would deprive women of ability to make a living.Then again in 1771, Richard Arkwright invents first automated spinning mill: This is one of the first examples of a fully automated industrial process.</p>
	
	<p>In 1880 – 1920 automation was increased by the discovery of electrification. This brought a new source of power to industry and allowed relay logic to develop which further increased the capability of automated machines. Then during the 1930’s Great Depression, unemployment and dissatisfaction cause a wave of mechanical skepticism. Technocrats blamed mechanical advancements for high unemployment rates.</p>
	
	<p>In 1964 during the Cybernation revolution the open memorandum sent to President Lyndon B. Johnson warning that machines will cause an increase in productive capacity while increasing unemployment. Service industry is signaled out as a probable candidate for automation. With Terminator and Matrix bening released into theaters in the following years, popular movies further cement the concept of an AI apocalypse into mainstream culture along with it the fear of automation making human redundant.</p>
	
	<p>Automation has continused to grow since it's start in 1589 Causing the beginning of industrialization. It has gotten more and more advanced with the discovery of new technoligys and the improvement of old. Automation has taken over more and more asspect of society as time goes on, increasing the productivety of human while phasing old manual industries. At the same time, it has created more jobs for people as the increased productivity made poeple richer and with more time, causing a rise in the entertainment industry. As automation continues to grow, it will take take over more and more of the things we are doing now, but at the same time it will cause the human race to grew and to and allowing poeple wo do things that is more important and more enjoyable.</p>
