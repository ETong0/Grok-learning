	<h2>Overview</h2>	
	
	<p>Sensors are used for robots to react based on what's happening around them. This allow them to preform more sofiticated tasks in an environment that is not controled and predictable. Sensors Allowes robots to make away from assembly lines, repeating the exact same action for thsounads of times and into the field of transportation, exproation and much more.</p>

	<h2>Types Of Sensors</h2>
	
	<h3>Infrared Sensors</h3>

	<p>Infrared sensors is used for to ditect infrared light in it's environment. This could be used to detect the amout of infrared radiation/heat emited by objects in the robots surounding environment or detect motion. Infrared sensor is also used with conbination of a device that emit infrared light to map the surounding to help the robot navagate. For example, this is used by the Roomba vacuum cleaner robot as bounce infrared light of object and back at it's infrared sensor to detect it's presence to allow it to navagate a room with ever changing layout.</p>
	
	
	<h3>Speech Recognition Senors</h3>

	<p>Speech recognition senors are a type of sensors that can pick up sound waves from it's environment but speach recognition conbines sophisticated computer programs that is programmed to recognise speech. This allows robot to interact with poeple in a way that is more natural to human, by communicating with speech. Right now there are two main way vioce recognition in robots, the first is in robots what made to allow human commands like Siri and Google home and the other is in AI research to make robots that can have smart comversation with human.</p>
	
	
	<h3>Radio Waves Sensors</h3>

	<p>Radio waves sensors are used to pick up the different frenquency of radio waves sent out by other electionic divices. Radio senor allows electronic divices to connunicate with each other wirlessly. Thgis allows them to have access infornations that they can't pick up themselves and to send send informations to other places to be processed. Radio wave sensors is used commenly is divices like GPS to access informetions from satellites and even in expensive exporatoin robots sent to Mars or deep ocean.</p>
